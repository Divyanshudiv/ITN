    "## Introduction to Weighted Finite State Transducers (WFSTs)\n",
    "Weighted Finite State Transducers (WFSTs) are automata where each transition between states is labeled with an input symbol, an output symbol, and a weight (usually representing cost or probability). These structures are commonly used in speech recognition, text normalization, and other fields where mapping between sequences with a cost function is needed.\n",

    "In this notebook, we'll explore how to construct your own WFST using the provided `WFST` class. We will go through key methods, explain their purposes, and demonstrate how to implement custom transitions and states.\n",

    "## WFST Class Overview\n",
    "The `WFST` class enables you to create a custom finite state transducer by adding states, transitions, and weights between them. Below is a list of the key methods and how they work:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `set_start_state(state)`: Sets and adds the start state of the WFST. This is the initial state from which transitions begin.\n",
    "- `add_state(state)`: Adds an intermediate state. States can represent different stages in the transducer.\n",
    "- `add_final_state(state)`: Marks the state as a final state, indicating that the transduction can successfully terminate when reaching this state.\n",
    "- `add_transition(from_state, to_state, input_symbol, output_symbol, weight)`:\n",
    "    - Adds a transition (or arc) from `from_state` to `to_state` based on the provided input and output symbols, with an associated weight (or cost).\n",
    "    - This is the core method for building relationships between states.\n",
    "- `add_epsilon_transition(from_state, to_state)`: Adds a transition between states without requiring an input (epsilon transition).\n",
    "- `process(input_sequence)`: Processes an input sequence, attempting to traverse the WFST and return the output sequence along with the total weight (or cost) of the path.\n"
